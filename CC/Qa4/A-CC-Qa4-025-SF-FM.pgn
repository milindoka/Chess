[Opening "Scandinavian Defense: Gr√ºnfeld Variation"]

1. e4 d5
{ The Scandinavian begins with 1. e4 d5. We recommend continuing by capturing the pawn with 2. exd5 where Black usually plays 2...Qxd5. 
 [%csl Re4][%cal Gd5e4] }
2. exd5 Qxd5
(2... Nf6 { Alternatively, Black sometimes plays 2...Nf6, the so-called Portuguese variation. It is best not to be greedy and hold onto the pawn, but simply continue development with a move like 3. Nf3 and after 3...Nxd5, play 4. d4 with c4 coming, Be2 or Bd3, with a comfortable advantage due to the space in the center. } 3. d4 (3. c4?! c6 4. dxc6 Nxc6 { Black has a lot of compensation for the sacrificed pawn. }) 3... Nxd5 4. Nf3)
3. Nc3
{ After the more popular 2...Qxd5, develop a piece and create a threat at the same time with 3. Nc3, attacking the queen. Here, Black has 3 main options, namely 3...Qa5, 3...Qd6 or 3...Qd8. Any other move, such as 3...Qe5+ is real beginners stuff and nothing to worry about. Simply block the check while developing (with Be2), and attack the queen again next move with d4 or Nf3.
In this article, we'll focus on the absolute main move 3...Qa5. 
 [%csl Rd5][%cal Gc3d5] }
3... Qa5
{ After 3...Qa5, d4 is the move common response. }
(3... Qd6 { This is a trendy line at the moment. A good setup for White is the following: } 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 a6 6. g3 { [%csl Rd6][%cal Yc1f4,Gf4d6] } 6... b5 7. Bg2 Bb7 8. O-O e6 9. Bf4 Qb6 10. a4 $14)
4. d4
{ White seizes space in the center and also makes room for the dark-squared bishop to develop. 
 [%csl Ra5][%cal Gc1d2,Yd2a5] }
4... Nf6 5. Nf3
{ Both sides develop their knights. 
 [%csl Ge5][%cal Yf3e5] }
5... c6
{ Black has to spend another move for playing ...c6 in oder to give his queen a retreat square. 
 [%csl Ra5][%cal Ga5d8,Ga5c7] }
6. Ne5
{ White plays an active multi-purpose move. The knight is actively placed on e5, eyeing the f7-pawn. It can also come to c4, winning a tempo against the Black queen. 
 [%csl Ra5,Ge5][%cal Ye5c4,Gc4a5,Ye5f7] }
6... Bf5
{ The main move for Black. Before he plays the move ...e6, he wants to bring his bishop out of the pawn chain. }
7. g4
{ White immediately challenges Black's bishop on g4. 
 [%csl Gg4,Rf5][%cal Gg4f5] }
7... Bg6
{ Black is already under severe pressure. White can go for an early h4-h5, threatening Black bishop even more. 
 [%csl Rg6,Gg2][%cal Yh2h4,Gh4h5,Gh5g6,Gf1g2] }
8. h4
{ White threatens to play h4-h5, winning a piece. 
 [%csl Rg6][%cal Gh4h5,Gh5g6] }
8... Nbd7
{ [%csl Rg6] }
(8... h6? { After ...h6, Black's pawn structure gets heavily damaged. } 9. Nxg6 fxg6 10. Bd3 { [%csl Rg6][%cal Gd3g6] } 10... Kf7 { [%csl Rf7][%cal Gf7g6] } 11. Bd2 { [%csl Ra5][%cal Gd2a5] } 11... Qc7 12. Qf3 { [%csl Rf6][%cal Gg4g5,Gg5f6] } 12... Nd7 13. g5 hxg5 14. Ne4! { [%csl Rg5][%cal Ge4g5] } 14... gxh4 15. Ng5+ Ke8 16. Ne6 Qd6 17. Bxg6#)
9. Nc4
{ [%csl Ra5][%cal Gc4a5] }
9... Qc7 10. h5
{ [%csl Rg6] }
10... Be4
{ [%csl Rh1][%cal Ge4h1] }
11. Nxe4
{ White wins the bishop pair and gains even more time to develop his pieces. }
11... Nxe4 12. Qf3
{ [%csl Re4][%cal Gf3e4] }
12... Nef6 13. Bf4
{ [%csl Rc7][%cal Gf4c7] }
13... Qc8
{ Compare the two positions - Black is not developed at all. White already has a winning advantage. }
14. g5
{ [%csl Rf6][%cal Gg5f6] }
14... Nd5
{ [%csl Re8,Rf8,Rc8,Rh8,Ra8] }
15. Bg3 e6 16. g6 hxg6 17. hxg6
{ [%csl Rf7][%cal Gf3f7,Yg6f7] }
